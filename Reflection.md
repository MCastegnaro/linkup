Questions:

○ Did you use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? If so, how?
○ What did you build or decide manually?
○ Where did you need to think critically or make decisions beyond AI suggestions?
○ What would you improve with more time?

Answer

Yes, I used an artificial intelligence called `UIzard` to help me create mockup prototypes of the user interface. For the rest of the application, I manually built the backend and frontend without using AI.

I improved the code standard, since time was short, I think I could improve in this aspect. I would also implement a settings screen so that the user could update their data and set which of the sections of the public area they would like to make private or public. I only did the backend and not the frontend for this feature.
